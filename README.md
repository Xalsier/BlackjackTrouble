# Blackjack Trouble
## A Visual Novel with different endings based on Blackjack Outcomes

It's mostly broken. I may return to this at some point.

## Roadmap

- Repair the images on the cards (Done)
- Proper positioning for the challenger character
- Optional animation for challenger character
- 1 Adversarial Minigame that isn't genuinely painful.

## Playtime

Currently, 1-3 minutes per challenger

Goal: Extend it to be longer, with dialog, animations, etc.
